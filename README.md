# Pomodoro Timer GUI

A **Pomodoro Timer** application built with Python's `tkinter` library. This timer helps you stay productive by breaking your work into focused intervals of 25 minutes, followed by short breaks of 5 minutes. After completing 4 work sessions, you are rewarded with a long break of 15 minutes. The application also displays checkmarks (`✓`) to track your completed work sessions.
